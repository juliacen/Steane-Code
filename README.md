# Steane's Code Under Random Pauli Error

**Author**: Julia Cen

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the construction and simulation of the **Steane Code**, a foundational [[7,1,3]] quantum error-correcting code. The notebook applies random Pauli errors to encoded quantum states and explores how Steane's code detects and corrects these errors, estimating the overall success probability.

## üìò Overview

Quantum computing systems are prone to decoherence and operational errors. The **Steane code**, developed in 1996, is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of a **Calderbank‚ÄìShor‚ÄìSteane (CSS)** quantum code. It is constructed using classical [7,4,3] Hamming codes and protects a single logical qubit using 7 physical qubits.

This notebook provides:

- A conceptual introduction to Steane‚Äôs code
- A complete simulation framework for encoding, introducing noise, detecting and correcting errors
- Analysis of the code's success probability under random single-qubit Pauli errors

## üß™ Contents

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

### 1. What is the Steane's Code?
A brief overview of quantum error correction and the theory behind the Steane code.

### 2. Building Steane's Code
- **The Code Structure**: Description of stabilizer generators and logical states
- **Encoding |x‚ü©**: Encoding process for arbitrary single-qubit states
- **Simulating Noise**: Application of random Pauli (X, Y, Z) errors
- **Error Detection**: Syndrome extraction to identify error patterns
- **Error Correction and Decoding**: Recovery of logical states

### 3. Success Probability
Numerical estimation of how well the Steane code performs against random single-qubit errors.

### 4. References
Foundational papers and online resources for further reading.
